Datasets with metadata showing difference between publication date and license start date.

- WoS sample: <wos_cr_licensing_md.csv>
- Crossref sample: <cr_sample_cr_licensing_md>

Comment submitted ot the authors:

> This is a great piece of work because it demonstrates how studying open access publishing on a large-scale can become more transparent and reusable. Particularly, I was exited to see that the underlying code, datasets and analysis were also shared, which allows a better understanding of the methods used in this study.

> After re-examining articles tagged as hybrid open access, I feel that more attention could have been drawn on the issue of delayed open access as already suggested by Mark Patterson. Unfortunately, it seems that a statement is missing that explains why the definition of hybrid open access used in this study differs from that mentioned in the literature review. More specifically, it remains unclear why delayed open access was not explicitly excluded from the category hybrid open access as many funders and libraries do. 

> In the beginning, I thought this was simply because applying licenses with different date than the publication indicating delayed open access is not widespread and was thus not relevant. However, obtaining licensing metadata from Crossref for articles with evidence "hybrid (via crossref license)" from both the Crossref and the WoS samples revealed that around 70 % of these articles were tagged with open licenses, which came into effect a certain period after publication. Because of this large proportion, as well as because of ongoing controversies about open access policies promoting hybrid open access, I think, a revised version would benefit from a more detailed analysis and explanation of delayed content licensing by publishers.
